# Training parameters

# num_epochs is the number of epochs. If you experiment with more
# complex networks you might need to increase this. Likewise if you add
# regularization that slows training.
num_epochs = 1

# learning_rate is a critical parameter that can dramatically affect
# whether training succeeds or fails. For most of the experiments in this
# project the default learning rate is safe.
learning_rate = 1e-4

# Momentum on the gradient (if you use a momentum-based optimizer)
momentum = 0.01
